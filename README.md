>> NPM does not stands for Node Package Manager
>> BUNDELERS : Parcel, Webpack, Vite, Rollup etc


>> ~ : used for automatically installing latest patch

>> React.createElement create an Object which after transpilation by babel get converted into the HTML which modify the DOM
>>JSX : Javascript syntax extension which allow us to write HTML like code inside our javasript file
